   - Contains the Hail 0.1 (stable) tutorial, adapted from here: https://hail.is/docs/stable/tutorials/hail-overview.html
2. [LeonarDemo.ipynb](https://github.com/DataBiosphere/leonardo/tree/develop/example-notebooks/LeonarDemo.ipynb)
   - Python 2 sample notebook which loads the FireCloud data model into pandas objects, interacts with Google Cloud Storage APIs, and runs a basic Hail job.
      - NOTE: references a demo workspace which no longer exists, so won't be runnable as-is.
3. [Notebooks_Demo_Manning_Lab.ipynb](https://github.com/DataBiosphere/leonardo/tree/develop/example-notebooks/Notebooks_Demo_Manning_Lab.ipynb)
   - Similar to the above but more involved and runs an analysis of publicly available 1000 genomes data. Developed by Alisa Manning's team for demonstration purposes.
4. [Safari_Online_Jupyter_Training.ipynb](https://github.com/DataBiosphere/leonardo/tree/develop/example-notebooks/Safari_Online_Jupyter_Training.ipynb)
   - Adaptation of [Safari online Jupyter training](https://www.safaribooksonline.com/public/online-training-jupyter/) which exercises some basic tools like pandas, numpy, and matplotlib in Python 3.
