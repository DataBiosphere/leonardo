        This API is used in conjunction with v2 runtime's autopause functionality. Since Azure runtimes are not proxied to Leonardo, the relay must send a 'keep-alive'
        message of sorts. If no requests are received after a period of time, the runtime will be stopped.
        Each request to this API does not result in the runtime's date accessed being updated. An async process is responsible for batching them and executing updates.

        URIs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Basics_of_HTTP/Data_URIs).

        Output, including any errors, will appear in `localization.log` in the working directory of the Jupyter notebook server.

        By default this operation will happen synchronously and the response status will reflect any errors encountered in the copy.

          * If either the source or destination is a GCS path, it will be sent to [gsutil cp](https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/gsutil/commands/cp). Therefore
            this can be used to localize a file _from_ a bucket _to_ the notebook server; or delocalize a file _from_ the notebook server _to_ a bucket.
          * If the source is a Data URI, then the destination file will be created with the decoded data URI contents. This mode can only be used to localize
            files to the notebook server.
          In both cases all paths will be quoted & sanitized, and intermediate local directories will be made.

          Note that duplicate keys will lead to unexpected behaviour, so specify the destination filename explicitly if you want to localize multiple files to the same directory.

      description: >
        If using Google token-based auth, clients can call this endpoint when a user's
        Google token should be invalidated (e.g. when logging out of the application).

        This endpoint will unset the Leo token cookie and invalidate caches to ensure
        the user's proxied connections stop working.

      summary: (Deprecated) Sets a browser cookie needed to authorize connections to a Leonardo runtime
      description: >
        If using Google token-based authorization to a runtime, the Leo proxy
        accepts a Google token passed as a cookie value. This endpoint facilitates setting that cookie.

        It accepts a bearer token in an Authorization header and responds with a Set-Cookie header.

        If no bearer token is present, it unsets the cookie by returning a Set-Cookie header with a null
        value and expiration date in the past.
