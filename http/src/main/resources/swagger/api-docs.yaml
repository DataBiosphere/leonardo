      description: >
        This API is used in conjunction with v2 runtime's autopause functionality. Since Azure runtimes are not proxied to Leonardo, the relay must send a 'keep-alive'
        message of sorts. If no requests are received after a period of time, the runtime will be stopped.
        Each request to this API does not result in the runtime's date accessed being updated. An async process is responsible for batching them and executing updates.

          JSON object. Keys represent destinations, values represent sources.
          The following rules apply:

          * If either the source or destination is a GCS path, it will be sent to [gsutil cp](https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/gsutil/commands/cp). Therefore
            this can be used to localize a file _from_ a bucket _to_ the notebook server; or delocalize a file _from_ the notebook server _to_ a bucket.
          * If the source is a Data URI, then the destination file will be created with the decoded data URI contents. This mode can only be used to localize
            files to the notebook server.
          In both cases all paths will be quoted & sanitized, and intermediate local directories will be made.

          Note that duplicate keys will lead to unexpected behaviour, so specify the destination filename explicitly if you want to localize multiple files to the same directory.

            The script is pulled once at runtime creation time; subsequent client changes to the user
            script at this URI do not affect the runtime. Timestamped logs for this script can be
