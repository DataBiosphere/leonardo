    // A note on akka-http philosophy:
    // The Akka HTTP server is implemented on top of Streams and makes heavy use of it. Requests come
    // in as a Source[HttpRequest] and responses are returned as a Sink[HttpResponse]. The transformation
    // from Source to Sink is done via a Flow[HttpRequest, HttpResponse, _].
    // For more information, see: http://doc.akka.io/docs/akka-http/10.0.9/scala/http/introduction.html

    // is not made until a Source and Sink are plugged into the Flow (i.e. it is materialized).

    // Now build a Source[Request] out of the original HttpRequest. We need to make some modifications
    // to the original request in order for the proxy to work:

    // 1. filter out headers not needed for the backend server
    val newHeaders = filterHeaders(request.headers)
    // 2. strip out Uri.Authority:
    val newUri = Uri(path = request.uri.path, queryString = request.uri.queryString())
    // 3. build a new HttpRequest

    // to the notebook server.
    // - the Source is the modified HttpRequest from above
    // - the Sink just takes the first element because we only expect 1 response

    // Note: we're calling toStrict here which forces the proxy to load the entire response into memory before
    // returning it to the caller. Technically, this should not be required: we should be able to stream all
    // data between client, proxy, and server. However Jupyter is doing something strange and the proxy only
    // works when toStrict is used. Luckily, it's only needed for HTTP requests (which are fairly small) and not
