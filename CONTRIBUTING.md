# Contributing

## External Contributions
External contribution guidelines coming soon. In the interim, comments and questions are welcome in the [Issues](https://github.com/DataBiosphere/leonardo/issues).

## Opening a Pull Request

You most likely want to do your work on a feature branch based on develop. There is no explicit naming convention; we usually use some combination of the JIRA issue number and something alluding to the work we're doing.

When you open a pull request, add the JIRA issue number (e.g. `GAWB-1234`) to the PR title. This will make a reference from JIRA to the GitHub issue. Add a brief description of your changes above the PR checkbox template.

This is also a good opportunity to check that the acceptance criteria for your JIRA ticket exists and is met. Check with your PO if you have any questions there. You should also fill out a summary to go in the release notes and some instructions on what QA should be looking at.

The checkboxes in the PR are important reminders to you, the developer. Please be conscientious and run through them when you open a PR.

## PR approval process

If your PR is particularly complex it can be helpful to add some commentary, either in the description or line-by-line in the GitHub PR view. In the latter case, consider whether those comments should be in the code itself.

You should get review from two people (either through GitHub's request-review feature, or by assigning the PR to them); one of them should probably be your tech lead, though ask. Do chase your reviewers (or find others) if they're slow; we don't like to let PRs linger. If you get PR feedback it's back to you to address it and then nudge your reviewers for re-review.

Your PR is ready to merge when all of the following things are true:

1. Two reviewers have thumbed (or otherwise approved) your PR
2. If your change is user-facing, your PO has seen it and signed off
3. All tests pass, including coverage

## API changes

All changes to the API _must_ be documented in Swagger.
