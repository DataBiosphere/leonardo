I, the developer opening this PR, do solemnly pinky swear that:

- [ ] I've documented my API changes in Swagger. Bump `version` field in [API doc](src/main/resources/swagger/api-docs.yaml).
- [ ] Get a thumbsworth of review and PO signoff if necessary
- [ ] In most cases, keep your pull request branch up-to-date before merging; You may by-pass this with admin privilege if the change is trivial.
