name: Consumer contract tests
# The purpose of this workflow is to run a suite of Leo contract tests against mock service provider(s) using Pact framework.
#
# More details about Contract Testing can be found in our handbook
#
# https://broadworkbench.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/IRT/pages/2660368406/Getting+Started+with+Pact+Contract+Testing
#
# This workflow involves Leo as a consumer, and ANY provider (e.g. Sam) Leo consumes.
# Each party owns a set of tests (aka contract tests).
#
#   Consumer contract tests (aka consumer tests) runs on a mock provider service and does not require a real provider service.
#   Provider contract tests (aka provider verification tests) runs independently of any consumer.
#
# Specifically:
#   Leo runs consumer tests against mock Sam service. Upon success, publish consumer pacts to
#   Pact Broker https://pact-broker.dsp-eng-tools.broadinstitute.org/.
#
#   Pact Broker is the source of truth to forge contractual obligations between consumer and provider.
#
#   This workflow meets the criteria of Pact Broker *Platinum* as described in https://docs.pact.io/pact_nirvana/step_6.
#   The can-i-deploy job has been added to this workflow to support *Platinum* and gate the code for promotion to default branch.
#
#   This is how it works.
#
#     Consumer makes a change that results in a new pact published to Pact Broker.
#     Pact Broker notifies provider(s) of the changed pact and trigger corresponding verification workflows.
#     Provider downloads relevant versions of consumer pacts from Pact Broker and kicks off verification tests against the consumer pacts.
#     Provider updates Pact Broker with verification status.
#     Consumer kicks off can-i-deploy on process to determine if changes can be promoted and used for deployment.
#
# NOTE: The publish-contracts workflow will use the latest commit of the branch that triggers this workflow to publish the unique consumer contract version to Pact Broker.
