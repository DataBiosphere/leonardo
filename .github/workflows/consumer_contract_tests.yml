name: Consumer contract tests
# The purpose of this workflow is to validate the service level contract
# using the Pact framework.
#
# More details on Contract Testing can be found in our handbook
#
# https://broadworkbench.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/IRT/pages/2660368406/Getting+Started+with+Pact+Contract+Testing
#
# The workflow involves two parties: Leo as a consumer. Sam as a provider.
# Each party owns a set of tests (aka contract tests).
#
#   The consumer contract tests (aka consumer tests) are completely independent of
#   the provider contract tests (aka provider tests), and vice versa.
#
# Specifically
#   Leo runs consumer tests against mock Sam service. Upon success, publish a consumer-provider pact to
#   Pact Broker https://pact-broker.dsp-eng-tools.broadinstitute.org/. Pact Broker is the source of truth
#   to forge contractual obligations between consumer and provider.
#
#   Sam obtains contract from Pact Broker and runs provider tests to validate its obligations to consumers.
#
# The Pact Broker is a 2-way street. The consumer can see in the dashboard if the service is able to honor their consumer expectations
# (which is also true when those expectations are updated).  The provider can validate that a desired deployment would not break any
# of the consumers' published expectations.  Both the consumer and the provider can gate deployment on availability/honoring of the published pact
# (contract expectations) between the two.
